        <b>DAILY DEVOTIONAL: PURGE YOUR HEART WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT OF GOD IN YOU, GET PREPARED TO BE USED AS A VESSEL FOR GOOD WORKS IN ALL COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE UNIVERSE.</b><br>
 2nd Timothy 2:21 said that if any person purges himself or herself from these evil acts (lust of flesh, lust of eyes, pride of life, secret faults, presumptuous sin, besetting sin), he or she shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified and meet for the master‚Äôs use and prepared unto every good work. On this basis, I ------------------------------------acknowledge that I am a temple of the Holy Spirit of God, an edifice, solid house built for the Holy Spirit of God to dwell in. Therefore, I-------------------------------------ask you Holy Spirit of God for the purging of my heart, the seat of my faith, the power house of my spirituality, firmly linked and connected to you Holy Spirit of God who dwells inside of me. Please purge my heart from all evil acts that will expose my heart to be contaminated, polluted,  creating rooms, chances, spaces in my heart to devise, nurse, harbour or grant access to participate in evil acts such as schemes, manipulations, plots of dispossession in whatever form and shape meant to bring pains of lack, deficiency, scarcity, deficit, removal, denial of complete victory, watered down victory, compromised victory, denial of already guaranteed rights, profits, benefits, fruits, hire, wages, dues and entitlements arising from legitimate productive activities  of other people created by God, wherever they dwell in the world, across the universe. In line with Psalms 66 vs 18, which said that if I regard iniquity in my heart the Almighty God shall not hear me,  Lord, please help me always to ensure that my heart is purge from all evil acts, so that my heart shall always be clean, pure, well prepared to fit my status as the temple of the Holy Spirit of God, reflecting the nature, the character, gifts and power of the Holy Spirit of God who live in me, works in me and through me. This disposition shall help me to be conscious that I am always filled up with compassion to see, speak out in truth, to other people created by God, to reach out to meet the needs of  those around me as occasion permits me, who live in compromised victory, watered down victory, whose already guaranteed rights are trampled upon, compromised, exposing them to live in repression,, suppression,, oppression, , subjugation,,  harassment,, intimidation, ,  persecution,,  coercion,  compelled to  be in all forms  of captivity, and slavery.  This will make it possible for me to live a sick-free life, free all forms of oppression, captivity, slavery in all areas of my life, physically, psychologically, economically, socially, and spiritually. Therefore, I -------------------------------------------- rise today with this consciousness that salvation is a personal race, I rise to my responsibility, to utilize all my skills, gifts, talents, time, space, energy, and other resources to effectively carry out my earthly assignments committed to me here on earth, to enable me become all that God has created me be. By these daily positive actions, I---------------------------as the temple of the Holy Spirit of God, shall be in the position always to be a well-prepared vessel unto honour, sanctified and fit to be used by the master, well prepared unto every good work. This shall help me to genuinely serve humanity and God in Spirit and in truth because God is not a scammer, or a fraudster, but a Spirit therefore those that must worship God must worship God in Spirit and in truth, as affirmed in John 4 vs 24 .. I ----------------------- declare that today and always, as a true worshiper, I shall take actions and inactions that shall be in alignment to principles, values imbedded in the word of God, which he use to create all things and Uphold all thing, in mighty name of Jesus Christ. Amen Remain Inspired and Great. Peace!   2025 Copy right reserved Mercy Ogechukwu (PhD).
